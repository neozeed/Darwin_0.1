          matching the (_N-th) open bracket in the top line.
        Each "find open bracket" command goes backward to the open bracket 
          matching the (_N-th) close bracket in the bottom line.
        ---------------------------------------------------
  m_<_l_e_t_t_e_r_>            Mark the current position with <letter>.
