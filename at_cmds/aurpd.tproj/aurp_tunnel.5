NAME
aurp_tunnel.cfg - format of the AURP configuration file

DESCRIPTION
The file aurp_tunnel.cfg provides configuration information for the
'aurpd(8)' command.  This file sets up the following information:
	local IP address for the local tunnel end-point
	remote IP addresses for remote tunnel end-points
	hidden network numbers
	advertised network numbers

The 'local' keyword specifies the IP address for the local end of all
AURP tunnels on this host.

The 'remote' keyword, which may be repeated, specifies the remote end
of one AURP tunnel.

The 'port' keyword specifies the UDP port number for local and remote
endpoints (this is for testing purposes only; the default, 387, should
normally be used).

The 'hide' keyword, which may be repeated, specifies an AppleTalk
network number that is not to be advertised in routing information
exchanges through the tunnel.

The 'export' keyword, which may be repeated, specifies an AppleTalk
network number that is to be advertised in routing information
exchanges through the tunnel.

The 'hide' and 'export' keywords are mutually exclusive.  'aurpd' will
complain and exit if both are specified.  If neither are specified,
all locally accessible network numbers will be advertised through the
tunnels.  If 'export' is specified, only those numbers in 'export'
statements will be advertised.  If 'hide' is specified, all locally
accessible network numbers *except* for those in 'hide' statements
will be advertised through the tunnels.
