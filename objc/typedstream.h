/*
 *	This modules saves data structures for later retrieval.  You can use typedstreams to save arbitrary C data, including Objective C objects, onto an arbitrary stream (see \fBNXStream\fR), such as a file, memory buffer, or pasteboard buffer.  The process of saving data is calling archiving, the process of retrieving the data unarchiving.
 *
 *	Not only data structures are written, but also their type, allowing for retrieval even in the absence of the code used for saving them.  Objective C objects are stored along with the full class hierarchy, allowing for translation of old classes into new classes.
 *	At writing time, a tight encoding is possible, because all the type information is present.  The encoding is not too tight, to allow for fast reading.  A check is done when reading data to confirm conformance of the stored data to the expected data.
 *	Any Objective C class can define its own write: and read: methods.  By default, nothing is saved. 
 *	Three types of versions are supported to allow for code evolution, not revolutions: typedstream versioning (used by the implementation), system versioning (used by NeXT), per class versioning (available for clients).
 *	Shared objects as well as shared C pointers remain shared after reading.
 *	Data structures to be saved can be carved at the level of their backpointers.

/***********************************************************************
 *	Writing and reading arbitrary data
 **********************************************************************/

/*
 *	The type of the data written follows the Objective C type string conventions <<Refer to Obj C documentation>>.  Supported descriptors:
 *		'c': char
 *		's': short
 *		'i': int
 *		'f': float
 *		'd': double
 *		'@': id
 *		'*': char *
 *		'%': NXAtom
 *		':': SEL
 *		'#': Class
 *		'!': int ignored
 *		{<type>} : struct
 *		[<count><itemType>] : array
 *
 *	Example, "{csi*@}" means a struct containing a char, a short, an int, a string and an object.  Type descriptor '%' implies at read time that the string is uniqued (using \fBNXUniqueString()\fR).
 *
 *	Objective C objects are written by sending write: to them, and read by sending read:.
 *	Write methods should look like:
 *	- write: (NXTypedStream *) s {
 *		[super write s];
 *		...code for writing instance variables defined at this class level ...
 *		};
 *
 *	Read methods should look like:
 *	- read: (NXTypedStream *) s {
 *		[super read s];
 *		...code for writing instance variables defined at this class level ...
 *		};
 *
 *	For being able to convert old files, it is critical that write: methods always perform [super write: s] before writing any other data.  In a similar fashion, read: methods must always perform [super read: s] before reading any other data.
 *	The current implementation performs write: methods twice, so no side effect should be performed in a write:. 
 *
 *	After reading an object, an awake message is performed, followed by an finishUnarchiving.  The purpose of the awake message is to give a chance to establish invariants within the object, and the purpose of startArchiving: (resp. finishUnarchiving) is to give a chance to replace the object to be written (resp. just read) by some other object.
