NTP v4.0.72j Release for Microsoft Windows NT          June 17th, 1998

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a dramatic reorganization of the source tree that separates the WinNT port into it's 
own directories, and cleans up many source code anomalies.


Possible enhancements and things left to do:
*	Additional reference clock drivers for NT beyond just the Local Clock (planned)
*	Control Panel Applet
*	Lock NT task into memory, so that it can't be paged out.
*	Integration with NT Performance Monitor
*	SNMP integration


Known problems:
*	Server precision has been reported at ~50ms, and should be able to 
	achieve approximately 10ms.

XNTP v3.5-90.1 Release for Microsoft Windows NT          June 7th, 1997

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several small bug fixes have been made, to XNTPD and NTPDATE.  No functionality changes have
occured since the last release.

Known problems:
*	Mutex timeout failure occurs sporatically with only a few reports
	of the problem.
*	Day Light Savings time changes seem to cause the XNTPD server to
	give up trying to regulate time, necessitating a restart of the XNTPD
	service.
*	One report of problems in a multihomed configuration.
*	Server precision has been reported at ~50ms, and should be able to 
	achieve approximately 10ms.

XNTP v3.5-87 Release for Microsoft Windows NT            December 14th, 1996
						  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Brief Installation Instructions

1.  If you currently have XNTP on this machine (any older version that was NOT
    installed using this GUI) you must STOP NOW, and REMOVE IT from your system
    before running this install program.  

2.  This installation program will create what it thinks are sensible defaults
    for the configuration files for XNTP.  If you have a tricky setup, let it 
    finish, then go back and stop the service (try the control panel applet) 
    and edit the configuration files.  The files will all be in the directory 
    you install into (default is %windir%\) and will be named as follows:
    
    	ntp.conf  - 	the NTP configuration file.
    	ntp.drift -	the NTP drift file
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building/compiling XNTP for Windows NT

To automate the build run either bldrel.bat or blddbg.bat... then run the
file install.bat in the scripts\wininstall\distrib directory for a 
manual installation. Run scripts\wininstall\intel\disk1\setup.exe
for the InstallShield based GUI installation.

****YOU MUST ****** modify the directory line in the ntp.conf or ntp.ini 
(it will accept either name)... and change the single slashes to double 
slashes ie. c:\winnt\ntp.conf becomes c:\\winnt\\ntp.conf

distribution.  The code compiles straight away using
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x.

Enhancements:
*	Local Clock reference clock now supported on NT
*	InstallShield based installation works



Possible enhancements and things left to do:
*	Additional Reference clock drivers for NT
*	Control Panel Applet
*	Integration with NT Performance Monitor
*	SNMP integration


Known Problems:
*	None

ANNOUNCE: Enhancements to the Windows NT port of XNTP 3.5
                                    (Network Time Protocol)



This set of changes fixes all known bugs, and it includes 
several major enhancements.

Many changes have been made both to the build environment as
well as the code.  There is no longer an ntp.mak file, instead
there is a buildntall.bat file that will build the entire 
release in one shot.  The batch file requires Perl.  Perl
is easily available from the NT Resource Kit or on the Net.

The multiple interface support was adapted from Larry Kahn's
work on the BIND NT port.  I have not been able to test it
adequately as I only have NT servers with one network 
interfaces on which to test.  

Enhancements:
*	Event Logging now works correctly.
*	Version numbers now work (requires Perl during build)
*	Support for multiple network interface cards (untested)
*	NTP.CONF now default, but supports ntp.ini if not found
*	Installation procedure automated.
*	All paths now allow environment variables such as %windir%

Bug fixes:
*	INSTSRV replaced, works correctly
*	Cleaned up many warnings
*	Corrected use of an uninitialized variable in XNTPD
*	Fixed ntpdate -b option
*	Fixed ntpdate to accept names as well as IP addresses
        (Winsock WSAStartup was called after a gethostbyname())
*	Fixed problem with "longjmp" in xntpdc/ntpdc.c that 
        caused a software exception on doing a Control-C in xntpdc.
	A Cntrl-C now terminates the program. 

See below for more detail:

      Note: SIGINT is not supported for any Win32 application including 
      Windows NT and Windows 95. When a CTRL+C interrupt occurs, Win32 
      operating systems generate a new thread to specifically handle that 
      interrupt. This can cause a single-thread application such as UNIX, 
      to become multithreaded, resulting in unexpected behavior. 


Possible enhancements and things left to do:
*	Reference clock drivers for NT (at least Local Clock support)
*	Control Panel Applet
*	InstallShield based installation, like NT BIND has
*	Integration with NT Performance Monitor
*	SNMP integration
*	Fully test multiple interface support


Known problems:
*       bug in ntptrace - if no Stratum 1 servers are available,
                such as on an IntraNet, the application crashes.
