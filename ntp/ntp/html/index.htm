<H4>Introduction</H4>

Note: The software contained in this distribution is available without
charge under the conditions set forth in the <A
HREF=copyright.htm>Copyright Notice</A>.

<P>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a
computer client or server to another server or reference time source,
such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client
accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens
of milliseconds on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS)
receiver, for example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple
redundant servers and diverse network paths, in order to achieve high
accuracy and reliability. Some configurations include cryptographic
authentication to prevent accidental or malicious protocol attacks.

<P>Background information on computer network time synchronization can
be found on the <A HREF=exec.htm>Executive Summary - Computer Network
Time Synchronization</A> page. Discussion on protocol conformance issues
and interoperability with previous NTP versions can be found in the <A
HREF=biblio.htm>Protocol Conformance Statement</A> page. Discussion on
year-2000 issues can be found in the <A HREF=y2k.htm>Year 2000
Conformance Statement page</A>. Background information, bibliography and
briefing slides suitable for presentations can be found in the <A

<H4>Building and Installing NTP</H4>

The <A HREF=build.htm>Building and Installing the Distribution
</A>page presents an overview of the procedures for compiling the
distribution and installing it on a typical client or server. The build
procedures inspect the system hardware and software environment and
automatically select the appropriate options for that environment. While
these procedures work with most computers and operating systems marketed
today, exceptions requiring manual intervention do exist, as documented
in the <A HREF=config.htm>Configuration Options </A>and <A
HREF=release.htm>Release Notes </A>pages.

<P>Bringing up a NTP primary server requires a radio or satellite
receiver or modem. The distribution includes hardware drivers for over
two dozen radio clocks and modem services. A list of the particular
receivers and modem drivers supported in the distribution is given in
the <A HREF=refclock.htm>Reference Clock Drivers </A>page. For most
popular workstations marketed by Digital, Sun and Hewlett Packard, as
well as widely available Unix clones such as FreeBSD and Linux, the
automatic build procedures select all drivers that run on the target
machine. While this increases the size of the executable binary
somewhat, individual drivers can be included or excluded using the
configure utility documented in the Configuration Options page.

<H4>Configuring Clients and Servers</H4>
<p>NTP is by its very nature a complex distributed network application
and can be configured and used for a great many widely divergent
timekeeping scenarios. The documentation presented on these pages
attempts to cover the entire suite of configuration, operation and
maintenance facilities which this distribution supports. However, most
applications will need only a few of these facilities. If this is the
case, the <a href=quick.htm>Quick Start</a> page may be useful to get a
simple workstation on the air with an existing server.

<p>However, in order to participate in the existing NTP synchronization
subnet and obtain accurate, reliable time, it is usually necessary to
construct an appropriate configuration file, commonly called
<TT>ntp.conf</TT>, which establishes the servers and/or external
receivers or modems to be used by this particular machine. Directions
for constructing this file are in the <A HREF=notes.htm>Notes on
Configuring NTP and Setting up a NTP Subnet </A>page. However, in many
common cases involving simple network topologies and workstations, the
file data can be specified entirely on the command line.

<P>The most important factor in providing accurate, reliable time is the
selection of modes and servers to be used in the configuration file. NTP
support for one or more computers is normally engineered as part of the
existing NTP synchronization subnet. The existing NTP subnet consists of
a multiply redundant hierarchy of servers and clients, with each level
in the hierarchy identified by stratum number. Primary servers operate
at stratum one and provide synchronization to secondary servers
operating at stratum two and so on to higher strata. In this hierarchy,
clients are simply servers that have no dependents.

<P>The NTP subnet in early 1998 includes 70 public primary (stratum 1)
servers synchronized directly to UTC by radio, satellite or modem and
located in every continent of the globe, except Antarctica (soon).
Normally, client workstations and servers with a relatively small number
of clients do not synchronize to primary servers. There are 106 public
secondary (stratum 2) servers synchronized to the primary servers and
providing synchronization to a total in excess of 100,000 clients and
servers in the Internet. The current lists are maintained in the <A
HREF=http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/index.htm>Information on Time
and Frequency Services</A> page, which is updated frequently. There are
numerous private primary and secondary servers not normally available to
the public as well. You are strongly discouraged from using these
servers, since they sometimes hide in little ghettos behind dinky links
to the outside world and your traffic can bring up expensive ISDN lines,
causing much grief and frustration.

<H4>Resolving Problems</H4>

Like other things Internet, the NTP synchronization subnets tend to be
large and devilishly intricate, with many opportunities for
misconfiguration and network problems. The NTP engineering model is
specifically designed to help isolate and repair such problems using an
integrated management protocol, together with a suite of monitoring and
debugging tools. There is an optional data recording facility which can
be used to record normal and aberrant operation, log problems to the
system log facility, and retain records of client access. The <A
HREF=debug.htm>NTP Debugging Techniques </A>and <A
HREF=hints.htm>Hints and Kinks </A>pages contain useful information
for identifying problems and devising solutions.

<P>Users are requested to report bugs, offer suggestions and contribute
additions to this distribution. The <A HREF=patches.htm>Patching
Procedures </A>page suggests procedures which greatly simplify
distribution updates, while the <A HREF=porting.htm>Porting Hints
</A>page suggest ways to make porting this code to new hardware and
operating systems easier. Additional information on reference clock
driver construction and debugging can be found in the <A
HREF=refclock.htm>Reference Clock Drivers </A>page. Further
information on NTP in the Internet can be found in the <A
