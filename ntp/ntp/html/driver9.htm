Magnavox MX4200 GPS Receiver</H3>

Synopsis</H4>
Address: 127.127.9.<I>u</I>
<BR>Reference ID: <TT>GPS</TT>
<BR>Driver ID: <TT>GPS_MX4200</TT>
<BR>Serial Port: <TT>/dev/gps<I>u</I></TT>; 4800 baud, 8-bits, no parity
<BR>Features: <TT>ppsclock</TT> (required)
<H4>
Description</H4>
This driver supports the Magnavox MX 4200 Navigation Receiver adapted to
precision timing applications. It requires the <TT>ppsclock</TT> line discipline
or streams module described in the <A HREF="ldisc.htm">Line Disciplines
and Streams Modules</A> page. It also requires a gadget box and 1-PPS level
converter, such as described in the <A HREF="pps.htm">Pulse-per-second
(PPS) Signal Interfacing</A> page.

<P>This driver supports all compatible receivers such as the 6-channel
MX 4200, MX 4200D, and the 12-channel MX 9212, MX 9012R, MX 9112.
<H4>
Operating Modes</H4>
This driver supports two modes of operation, static and mobile, controlled
by clock flag 2.

<P>In static mode (the default) the driver assumes that the GPS antenna
is in a fixed location. The receiver is initially placed in a "Static,
3D Nav" mode, where latitude, longitude, elevation and time are calculated
for a fixed station. A DOP-weighted running average position is calculated
from this data. After 24 hours, the receiver is placed into a "Known Position"
mode, initialized with the calculated position, and then solves only for
time. The position averaging algorithm does not take into account boundary
conditions, so this mode of operation very near the international date
line or the poles is not recommended.

<P>In mobile mode, the driver assumes the GPS antenna is mounted on a moving
platform such as a car, ship, or aircraft. The receiver is placed in "Dynamic,
3D Nav" mode and solves for position, altitude and time while moving. No
position averaging is performed.
<H4>
Monitor Data</H4>
The driver writes each timecode as received to the <TT>clockstats</TT>
file.
