/*
 *  LDAPMessage memory management is implemented in the following
 *  manner.
 *
 *  An instance of LULDAPArray "owns" the LDAPMessage chain;
 *  instances of LULDAPDictionary have a pointer into the
 *  chain which they DO NOT own.
 *
 *  Thus, every instance of LULDAPDictionary must be associated
 *  with an LULDAPArray; even dictionaries returned by non-
 *  enumeration methods.
 *
 *  When the dictionaries are retained by the "mother" array 
 *  such that the array is not dealloced until the dictionaries
 *  have, there are no potential problems.
 *
 *  If the array is dealloced before a dictionary which points
 *  into it is, there are potential problems. However, once
 *  the dictionaries have left the scope of LDAPAgent (in
 *  which the mother arrays are not explicitly released) they
 *  are ostensible instances of LUDictionary. Consequently, there is
 *  no way for the LDAPMessage pointer to be referenced
 *  within the body of lookupd. (The pointer is essentially
 *  used for convenience, in "binding" LDAP attributes to
 *  dictionary keys.) Obviously, -[LULDAPDictionary dealloc]
 *  doesn't touch the message pointer; -[LULDAPArray dealloc]
 *  frees the chain.
 *
 *  For the record, an alternative and slightly clearer method
 *  would involve each dictionary owning its own chain, which
 *  would be built at init time. The ldap_add_result_entry()
 *  function could be used to populate the chain with its
 *  sole entry.
 *
 *  Changes: August 1997
 *  Did away with autoreleasepools. Thus the array is freed in
 *  firstEntry: not by the autoreleasepool.
 *
 *  Changes: October 1997
 *  Fixed memory leak. If the parser returns nil (usually because
 *  ASSERT_TRUE() fails) then we remember to free the dictionary.
 *  Arguably the parser should do this itself, but it was much simpler
 *  to put this in LULDAPArray.
 *
 *  Changes: January 1998
 *  Fixed another memory leak. Classes which return nil in init should
 *  dealloc (or, if they're retained by the watchdog, release)
 *  themselves before returning nil. LDAPAgent needed to be more
 *  careful in checking return values from init. 
 *
 *  Changes: February 1998
 *  Now that categories are supported, all the parsing is done in the
 *  designated initializer. The advantage of this is that we never need
 *  to keep an array with unparsable entries around for very long. 
 *
 *  Changed the array from a subclass to a category.
 *  *AND* remembered to call [self init] instead of [super init].
