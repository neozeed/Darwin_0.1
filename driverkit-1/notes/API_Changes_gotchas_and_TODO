API changes - gotchas/TODO

* options for IOEnqueueDma(), etc - need to be in file shared by user_driver.h and NRWDirectDevice. (DONE in driverTypes.h)

* need separate deviceMaster-like port for IODeviceMaster - this stuff should not need root privilege. (?)

* make NXDIsk ensure that physicalDisk conformsTo(IOPhysicalDiskMethods) before
  completing registration. (DONE in IODisk.m)
  
* Need clean dequeueDma() method in nrw/directDevice.h. DONE

* implement:

	* bdevsw/cdevsw add functions
	* method in NRWDirectDevice to cover IOEnqueueDmaInt()
	* dbohman's IONetDevice ==> driverkit ==> mknrw
	  still need to merge into mknrw.
	* Get legal typedefs in i386/driverTypes.h (waiting for input from
  	  Kathy and Dave B.) DONE
	* implement +connectToIndirectDevices in IODevice. DONE
	* Rewrite mknrw's autoconfig to use connectToIndirectDevices per
	  addenda in doc/loadingDevices.rtf.
	* iostat using IODeviceMaster. Do this after first pass of 
	  integration to minimize variables during debug.
	* probeAndInit Example needs to be rewritten. Currently disabled.
	* userDriver example can be improved. 
	* nrw Ethernet needs a lot of work to make it an NRWDirectDevice using
	  IONetwork.
	* bsd/dev/nrw direct devices should work, but need to be converted
	  to use directDevice(NRW) methods.
	  
* EventDriver does a probe in evFrameBufferDevicePort. It's probably wrong...
  attachEventSource has one too, maybe it juswt needs a declaration.
