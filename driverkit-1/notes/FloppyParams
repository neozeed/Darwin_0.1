what are all of these weird structs?

fd_disk_info (fd_disk_info_t): fd_extern.h
	maps media_id to tracks_per_cyl and num_cylinders.
	One per media_id in fdDiskInfo[].

fd_sectsize_info (fd_sectsize_info_t): fd_extern.h
	contains ector size, 82077 sector size codem sects_per_track, gap.
	One of these for each legal density/sectsize combo in ssi_Xmb[].

fd_density_info (fd_density_info_t) : fd_extern.h 
	Maps density to capacity and mfm.
	One per density in fdDensityInfo[].
	
fd_format_info (fd_format_info_t, fdFormatInfo_t) : fd_extern.h
	Contains all current info about inserted disk. 
	fd_disk_info, fd_density_info, fd_sectsize_info, total_sects, flags.
	Obtained via ioctl(FDIOCGFORM).
	
fdDensitySectsize_t : FloppyTypes.h
	maps density to an array of legal fd_sectsize_info's.
	One per legal density in fdDensitySectsize[].
	
fdDriveInfo_t : FloppyPublic.h
	drive_info (for ioctl(DKIOCGINFO)), seek, settle, unload time.
	One per drive type (only one) in fdDriveInfo[].
