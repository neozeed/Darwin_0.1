FAKE_HARDWARE testing of AdbDriver

* have one "device" which generates reasonable data and an interrupt when:
  -- autopoll gets enabled, or maybe a second after that
  -- any talk register n, n!=0 is executed for that address
  -- any listen register 0 - more TBD
  
  mods to 
	enableAutoPoll
	doUserCommand
	waitForInterrupt - need to generate timeouts
