			ADB questions
			
* Where's the definition of "how many bytes per register" and "what does
  the data in register n mean"?
  
  -- device-specific...AdbDriver will fetch all of 'em.
  
* On a "Talk register 3" when two devices currently have the same address, why
  will only one device detect a collision? What if device A returns 0x01 and
  device B returns 0x02? They'll both see a collision (0x03 will be on the 
  bus...).
  
  -- loser jumps off bus on first bad bit! It works.
  
* How to handle bus reset - AdbKeyboard and AdbMouse objects should free
  themselves? How to re-probe??
  
* Keyboard mapping...inside AdbKeyboard?
