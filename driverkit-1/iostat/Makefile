# This makefile will recursive invoke itself after cd'ing to OBJROOT.
# When invoked in the OBJROOT will have the following macros defined:
#	SRCDIR -- path to the directory containing this Makefile
#	SYMROOT -- path to the directory that is to contain the result
#		of this build
#
# E.g.
# foo.o:	foo.c foo.h
