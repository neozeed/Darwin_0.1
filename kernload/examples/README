{\f0\fs24\fi0\li0\ql\gray0 This directory contains two examples of loadable kernel servers using the kern_loader(8) dynamic kernel server loader.\
\
Simple is a trivial kernel server that provides two services:  The first prints a message on the console from the kernel; the second returns the kernel version string to the caller.\
\
Slot is an upgraded slot driver that allows memory mapped access to a card located on the NextBus.  It also provides a facility for turning interrupts generated by that card into messages that are sent to the designated Mach port.\
\
Thread is a simple kernel server that creates a kernel thread and deletes it when unloaded.\
\
See the README files in each of the example directories for more information.}
