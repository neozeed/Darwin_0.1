Rhapsody Secondary Loader
21 November 1997

Requires the latest compiler update from Sam Figueroa to properly support inline
functions.

SecondaryLoader/SecondaryLoader
- Based on Eryk Vershen's latest Secondary Loader (vers3r:/home/eryk/NeXTBoot)
- Ported from MkLinux to Rhapsody PPC

bin/macho-to-xcoff-eng
- Based on Peter Bradstreet's macho-to-xcoff (~evershen/NeXTBoot/machoToXCOFF)
- Fixed: optional header fields were not updated
- Fixed: section file offsets were incorrect (off by 120 bytes)
- Added: third argument for entry point (instead of decoding the UNIX thread segment
  for the srr0 register).

bin/macho-to-xcoff
- Bourne shell script with same arguments as the original macho-to-xcoff executable
- Uses 'nm' to get the entry point
- Calls macho-to-xcoff-eng

bin/mkdirs
- Bourne shell script
- Replaces /usr/bin/X11/mkdirhier for MkLinux and /bin/mkdirs for OpenStep

bin/decode_xcoff
- Based on ~evershen/NeXTBoot/machoToXCOFF
- Dumps xcoff header

bin/decode_macho
- Dumps mach-o sections and data (maybe too much data)
