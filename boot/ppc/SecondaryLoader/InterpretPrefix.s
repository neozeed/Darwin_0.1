;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;		 <5>	11/27/96	ABM		Fix i-cache invalidate loop controls.
;		 <4>	11/25/96	ABM		Invalidate i-cache PROPERLY. Also notice if 2ary loader fails.
;		 <3>	11/13/96	ABM		Needs to be i-cache coherent for code that is loaded by FORTH.
;		 <2>	 4/22/96	ABM		Ditch bogus boot-unit# scheme in favor of patching to make the
;									"right way" work.
;		 <2>	 4/22/96	ABM		Ditch bogus boot-unit# scheme in favor of patching to make the
;									"right way" work.
;		 <1>	 4/16/96	ABM		First checked in.
;		<4+>	 4/15/96	ABM		#1339239: Still not fixed: It's not SAFE to return from a client
;									program, I think.  Use broken system folder icon
;									stuff in Secondary Loader instead.
;		 <4>	 4/15/96	ABM		#1340785: Add alignment directive at end since assembler seems
;									unsure of the size of a NUL byte
;		 <3>	  4/9/96	ABM		#1339239: Return to caller if secondary loader returns ZERO for
;									tertiary loader's %srr0 value.
;		 <2>	  3/7/96	ABM		Return to using mac-parts style load of secondary loader.  Add
;									more parameters passed from secondary loader to tertiary loader
;									it finds and loads.
;		 <1>	  3/5/96	ABM		This is the prefix I would use to get interpreted FORTH to
;							execute as loaded by mac-parts.
