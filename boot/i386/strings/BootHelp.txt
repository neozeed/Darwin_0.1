The boot: prompt waits ten seconds for you to type advanced startup options.
If you don't type anything, the computer continues starting up normally: It
uses the kernel and configuration files on the startup device, which it also
uses as the root device.  Advanced startup options use the following syntax:

    <<device>kernel> <arguments>

For example, to start up from:
  the first SCSI device, type: sd()mach_kernel
  the b partition of the second IDE disk, type: hd(1,b)mach_kernel
  the floppy disk but use the SCSI disk as the root device, type:
    fd()mach_kernel rootdev=sd0a

If the computer won't start up properly, you may be able to start it up using
the drivers you used to install Rhapsody. Type: config=Default

To continue starting up using standard options, press Return.
