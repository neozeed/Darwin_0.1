;	dspsounddi.asm - dsp-initiated dma in both directions
;	Created from jos example di_dma.asm
;	Copyright 1990 NeXT, Inc.
;
;Typical use:
;
;		include	"dspsounddi.asm"
;	main
;		<user initialization>
;		jsr	start
;	loop
;		jsr	getHost		;called zero or more times
;		<some calculations>
;		jsr	putHost		;called one or more times
;		jcs	exit		;in case host aborts
;		<some loop condition ??>
;		j??	loop		;
;	exit
;		<user shutdown, i.e. ramp down for graceful abort>
;		jmp	stop
;
;The including code must set up LEADPAD and TRAILPAD equates.  Theses should be zero
;if writing to the host and the following if streaming to soundout:
;LEADPAD	equ	2	  ;number of buffers before sound begins
;TRAILPAD	equ	4	  ;number of buffers after sound ends
;This is necessary because the sound driver requires lead pad because it starts soundout
;DMA right away - while the DSP is still producing the first
;real buffer.
;
;
;Modification History
;	07/16/90/mtm	Free up r6, calc buffer start addresses on the fly.
;	07/26/90/mtm	Remove LEADPAD and TRAILPAD equates.
;			Don't include i/o code files.

; In the future, the int may specify more ints to follow.
; arg = 24bits = (8,,16) = (op,datum)

;	and datum = 1 for "software fix" needed for DMA chips less than rev. 313
