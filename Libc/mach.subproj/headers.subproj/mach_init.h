 * HISTORY 
 * $Log:	mach_init.h,v $
 * 08-May-90  Morris Meyer (mmeyer) at NeXT
 *	Added prototypes for thread_reply(), host_self(), 
 *	host_priv_self().task_notify(), thread_self(), init_process(),
 *	swtch_pri(), swtch(), thread_switch(), mach_swapon().
 *
 * 22-Mar-90  Gregg Kellogg (gk) at NeXT
 *	Removed task_notify() macro (can't use it on NeXT, as it must
 *	be allocated by those who needed.  The trap is the best way to
 *	retrieve this.
 *
 *	Added bootstrap port.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  89/06/13  16:45:00  mrt
 * 	Defined macros for thread_reply and made task_data be another
 * 	name for thread_reply, as task_data() is no longer exported from
 * 	the kernel.
 * 	[89/05/28            mrt]
 * 
 * 	Moved definitions of round_page and trunc_page to
 * 	here from mach/vm_param.h
 * 	[89/05/18            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  89/05/05  18:45:39  mrt
 * 	Cleanup and change includes for Mach 2.5
 * 	[89/04/28            mrt]
