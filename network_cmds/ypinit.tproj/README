The files Makefile.yp.dist and Makefile.main.dist should NEVER be changed,
they will be overwritten by eg make build.

Local changes can be done in Makefile.yp and Makefile.main. They are replace
by make in /usr/src/etc which normaly isn't done.

We don't depend on bsdmake anymore. 

We now build rpc.byname, a non standard map but one lookupd expects to
see.

We still should filter the default /etc/services, see PR-2207919.
