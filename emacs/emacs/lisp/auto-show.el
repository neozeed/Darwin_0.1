;;; auto-show.el --- perform automatic horizontal scrolling as point moves

;;; Commentary:

;;; This file provides functions that
;;; automatically scroll the window horizontally when the point moves
;;; off the left or right side of the window.

;;; Once this library is loaded, automatic horizontal scrolling
;;; occurs whenever long lines are being truncated.
;;; To request truncation of long lines, set the variable
;;; Setting the variable `truncate-lines' to non-nil.
;;; You can do this for all buffers as follows:
;;;
;;; (set-default 'truncate-lines t)

;;; Here is how to do it for C mode only:
;;;
;;; (set-default 'truncate-lines nil)	; this is the original value
;;; (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
;;;   "Run when C-mode starts up.  Changes ..."
;;;   ... set various personal preferences ...
;;;   (setq truncate-lines t))
;;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
;;;
;;;
;;; As a finer level of control, you can still have truncated lines but
;;; without the automatic horizontal scrolling by setting the buffer
;;; local variable `auto-show-mode' to nil.  The default value is t.
;;; The command `auto-show-mode' toggles the value of the variable
;;; `auto-show-mode'.

;;; Code:

(defvar auto-show-mode t
  "*Non-nil enables automatic horizontal scrolling, when lines are truncated.
The default value is t.  To change the default, do this:
	(set-default 'auto-show-mode nil)
See also command `auto-show-mode'.
This variable has no effect when lines are not being truncated.
This variable is automatically local in each buffer where it is set.")

(defvar auto-show-shift-amount 8 
  "*Extra columns to scroll. for automatic horizontal scrolling.")

(defvar auto-show-show-left-margin-threshold 50
  "*Threshold column for automatic horizontal scrolling to the right.
If point is before this column, we try to scroll to make the left margin
visible.  Setting this to 0 disables this feature.")
