;;; Commentary:a
;;
;;    Automatically scroll horizontally when the point moves off the
;;    left or right edge of the window.  
;;
;;    - Type "M-x hscroll-mode" to enable it in the current buffer.
;;    - Type "M-x hscroll-global-mode" to enable it in every buffer.
;;    - "turn-on-hscroll" is useful in mode hooks as in:
;;          (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-hscroll)
;;
;;    - hscroll-margin controls how close the cursor can get to the edge 
;;      of the window.
;;    - hscroll-step-percent controls how far to jump once we decide to do so.
;;
;;    Most users won't want to mess with the other variables defined
;;    here.  But they're all documented, and they all start with
;;    "hscroll-" if you're curious.
;;
;;    Oh, you should also know that if you set the hscroll-margin and
;;    hscroll-step-percent large enough, you can get an interesting, but
;;    undesired ping-pong effect as the point bounces from one edge to
;;    the other.
