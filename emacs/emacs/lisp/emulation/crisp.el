;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides keybindings and minor functions to duplicate the
;; functionality and finger-feel of the CRiSP/Brief editor.  This
;; package is designed to facilitate transitioning from Brief to Emacs
;; with a minimum amount of hassles.

;; Enable this package by putting the following in your .emacs
;; (require 'crisp)
;; and use M-x crisp-mode to toggle it on or off.

;; This package will automatically default to loading the scroll-all.el
;; package unless you put (setq crisp-load-scroll-lock nil) in your
;; .emacs.  If this feature is enabled, it will bind Meta-F1 to the
;; scroll-all mode toggle.

;; Also, the default keybindings for this mode override the Meta-x key to
;; make it exit the editor.  If you don't like this change, you can
;; prevent this key from being rebound with
;; (setq crisp-override-meta-x nil) in your .emacs.

;; Finally, if you want to change the string displayed in the modeline
;; when this mode is in effect, override the definition of
;; `crisp-mode-modeline-string' in your .emacs.  The default value is
;; " *Crisp*" which may be a bit lengthy if you have a lot of things
;; being displayed there.

;; All these overrides should go *before* the (require 'crisp) statement.

;; local variables
