* Add functions next-char-property-change and
previous-char-property-change which are like
next-single-property-change and previous-single-property-change except
that they consider overlays as well as text properties.

* Make movemail work with IMAP.

* Add ANSI C prototypes to the header files.

* Implement a graphical menu bar ("tool bar").

* Replace finder.el with something that generates an Info file
  which gives the same information through a menu structure.

* Add a feature to specify a line which will be displayed at the top
  of a window, much the way the mode line is displayed at the bottom.

* Convert additional packages to use defcustom.

* Change vc-directory so that in the CVS case
  it does `cvs status .' to get the whole directory status at once
  and then parse the output to find out about each file.

* Change the Windows NT menu code
  so that it handles the deep_p argument and avoids
  regenerating the whole menu bar menu tree except
  when the user tries to use the menubar.

  This requires the RIT to forward the WM_INITMENU message to
  the main thread, and not return from that message until the main
  thread has processed the menu_bar_activate_event and regenerated
  the whole menu bar.  In the mean time, it should process other messages.

* Enable use of X toolkit scroll bars.

* Put cross-references into the documentation strings.
(See the docref.el package for how they can work.)

* Implement radio buttons in menus for real.

* Handle keymap properties of strings that appear in the mode line, so
that different parts of the mode line can have different mouse
activity.

* Save undo information in files, and reload it when needed
for undoing.

* Support multiple terminal-input descriptors,
and thus allow having both terminal and X frames at once.

* modify lisp/ps-print.el to handle multibyte characters.

* modify comint.el so that input appears in a special font.
I can add a simple Emacs feature to help.

* Implement other text formatting properties.
** Spaces of fractional width.
** Footnotes that can appear either in place
or at the end of the page.
** text property that says "don't break line in middle of this".
Don't break the line between two characters that have the
same value of this property.
** Discretionary hyphens that disappear at end of line.
** Text property for raising or lowering text.
** Text property for making text smaller or bigger by one level of size.

* Implement use of mmap to allocate buffers, when mmap exists.
