       the element for the line's first column (at the window's left margin)
       is that character's position.
       For successive columns within a multicolumn character,
       the element is -1.
       For the column just beyond the last glyph on a line,
       the element is the buffer position of the end of the line.
       For following columns within the same window, the element is 0.
       For rows past the end of the accessible buffer text,
       the window's first column has ZV and other columns have 0.

       Mode lines and vertical separator lines have 0.

       The column of a window's left margin
       always has a positive value (a buffer position), not 0 or -1,
       for each line in that window's interior.  */
