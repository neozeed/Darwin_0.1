sect(The clone Module)
The tt(clone) module makes available one builtin command:

startitem()
findex(clone)
cindex(shell, cloning)
cindex(cloning the shell)
cindex(terminal)
item(tt(clone) var(tty))(
Creates a forked instance of the current shell, attached to the specified
var(tty).  In the new shell, the tt(PID), tt(PPID) and tt(TTY) special
parameters are changed appropriately.  tt($!) is set to zero in the new
shell, and to the new shell's PID in the original shell.

The return value of the builtin is zero in both shells if successful,
and non-zero on error.
