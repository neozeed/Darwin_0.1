ZSH ON SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------------

These are the OSes that zsh has been tried on.  If you succeed in getting
zsh to work on an OS not listed, let us know.

On all machines if you use gcc and upgrade your OS you must rebuild gcc
after the OS upgrade.  A gcc left from a previous OS may seem to work
but compiling more complex programs may fail mysteriously.

The format of entries is thus:

	Vendor: OS & version (hardware type) [zsh version tried]
		information

Machines
--------

Cray: Unicos (C90 and T90)
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Data General: DG/UX 5.4R3.10 MU01 (various AViiONs)
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

DEC: Ultrix (Alpha or DECstation)
DEC: Mach 3.0 (DECstation 5000/25)
DEC: OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 3.*, DEC Unix 4.* (Alpha)
	In OSF/1 3.x, there is apparently a bug in the header file
	/usr/include/rpcsvc/ypclnt.h; the prototype for yp_all() has a
	struct ypall_callback as its final argument, which should be a
	pointer (struct ypall_callback *).  This prevents compilation of
	one of zsh' files (zle_tricky.c).  If you can't modify the header
	file, create a directory called `rpcsvc' in zsh's Src subdirectory
	and put a fixed version of the header file to it before compiling.

	The strip coming with gcc-2.7.2 seems to create unusable binaries.
	This problem is not related to zsh.  If you have such problems,
	remove the bogus strip and use /bin/strip instead.

FreeBSD: FreeBSD 2.2.7 [3.1.4]
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

HP: HP-UX 9, 10.20
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

IBM: AIX
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Linux: Linux (i386) [3.1.4]
	If you are using an early minor version of libc 5, then a bug
	in the auto-configuration process may cause zsh to think that
	your system doesn't support the lstat function.  If the configure
	process reports that there is no lstat, edit config.h and change
	HAVE_LSTAT to 1.  libc-5.2.18 or later does not have this problem.

NetBSD: NetBSD 1.*
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Next: NextStep 3.*
	Should build `out-of-the-box', but the zsh malloc routines are
	not recommended.

Reliant: Reliant UNIX
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Reliant: SINIX
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.	There is a bad combination of
	static and shared libraries that prevents the use of dynamic
	linking; configure now detects this and will disable dynamic
	linking even if you requested it.

SGI: IRIX 5.1.1.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

Sun: SunOS 4.1.*
	Under 4.1.3 if yellow pages is used, username completion may cause
	segmentation violation.  This is a bug in the shared library not
	in zsh.  Some libc.so.1.9.* has this bug (it fails in yp_all).
	Statically linked binaries will work if linked with libc.so.1.8.1
	(which means that if you can get a statically linked binary
	compiled under 4.1.2 that it will probably work).  An alternative
	but untested solution may be to undefine HAVE_NIS in config.h.
	This may work, but the first username completion will be _very_
	slow (as slow as in tcsh).

Sun: Solaris 2.*
	The UCB versions of the routines for reading directories are not
	usable (the struct definitions are incompatible with the ones
	assumed by zsh).  The symptom of this is that globbed filenames in
	the compiled version of zsh will be missing the first two letters.
	To avoid this, make sure you compile zsh without any reference
	to /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  You can easily do this
	by just unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before building zsh.
