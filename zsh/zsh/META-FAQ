META-FAQ for the Z Shell
------------------------

The latest version of this META-FAQ can be found at any of the FTP sites
listed below.

Author
------

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad <pf@zsh.org>.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list <zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu>.  The development is currently
coordinated by Andrew Main (Zefram) <zefram@zsh.org>.  The coordinator
can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.

sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with (G)
